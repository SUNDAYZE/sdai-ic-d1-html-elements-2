    <h2>The Golden Spiral : A Journey into the Fibonacci Foodtruck</h2>
    <p>The Fibonacci Foodtruck is not just a name, but a symbol of the harmonious blend of mathematics and culinary art.
        The
        name ‘Fibonacci’ was inspired by the famous Italian mathematician, Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci. He
        introduced the Fibonacci sequence to the Western world in his 1202 book “Liber Abaci”. This sequence, where each
        number
        is the sum of the two preceding ones, has found applications in various fields, including art, architecture, and
        nature.</p>
